input A, B
	A = (A + B) * B
	C = A - 5
output C


test1: Confirm C = A - 5 statement

    // Operation op3 = AllOperations[*indx[2]];

    return op1(op2(A, B), B);
    // return op3(A, 5);
A=0
B=0

if C = -5	the second expression is implemented correctly,
			else wrong constant is implemented in the source code.

understanding wrong value:
- C value indicates the incorrect constant that is implemented, either as whole,
  or as   // Handle division by zero



test2: Confirm if *B is implemented correctly in the A = (A+B)*B statement

A=5	
B=-5
 
if C = -5	*B is implemented correctly

understanding wrong value:
if C = 0  : *B is missing
if C = 10 : A - 5 is most likely wrongly implemented as A + 5
if C = 25 : A - 5 is most likely wrongly implemented as A * 5
if C = 1  : A - 5 is most likely wrongly implemented as A / 5
if C = ?  : operation could be wrong or


test3: Confirm (A+B) is implemented correctly
